Feature: As a harried FiDi commuter
  I want to know about trains leaving Montgomery St station
  So I know whether I need to walk fast or not

Background:
  Given I launch the app

Scenario: Searching for upcoming trains for Montgomery St station
  Given BART says there is a train leaving from "mont" for "Richmond" in 4 minutes
  When I choose "Montgomery St" from the list of stations 
  Then I should see a train leaving for "Richmond" in 4 minutes
